SORT OF DONE
- create a (or several) production function (leontieff, cobb douglas)

NOT DONE
- production based on expected sales + desired inventories?
- consumption based on ?
- create the market interaction
- create a class for industries which hold firms: agriculture (12%), food industry (10%), other manufactures (20%), commerce (10%), transportation (12%), construction (5%), services (rest)
- transform economic structure data into industries and firms
- transform demographic/labour data into consumer objects (1 consumer per 10k people?)
- assign people to industries according to the data
- model behaviour from firms (specific to industries?) and people
- model government
- model financial sector?
- consolidate with actual data
- interface where you can create / save / load economic structure




HOW TO IMPLEMENT INTERACTION?
- Consumer checks consumption/saving behaviour to determine how much to spend
- Consumer checks consumption behaviour to determine how to distribute expenses -> return a dictionary?
- Consumer goes to each industry and buys from a random firm? Looks for the cheapest firm? Looks a little bit but not too much?
