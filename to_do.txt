BUGS



HOW TO IMPLEMENT INTERACTION?
- Consumer checks consumption/saving behaviour to determine how much to spend
- Consumer checks consumption behaviour to determine how to distribute expenses -> return a dictionary?
- Consumer goes to each industry and buys from a random firm? Looks for the cheapest firm? Looks a little bit but not too much?
