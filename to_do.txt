BUGS



firms look for desired production
-> firms see if they can produce that much
-> if they can't, they enter the labor market and the capital market to be able to (check if investment is desirable in
the long term?)
-> unemployed enter the labor market
-> how do firms decide the wage to offer? wage offered adjusted by periods without finding workers? how do consumers decide the reservation wage? wage as a function of time unemployed and wealth
-> once this round is over, the firms actually produce what they want
-> the firms pay the workers
-> the workers consume
-> the round starts again



SORT OF DONE
- create dataframe with the data from every month
- create a (or several) production function (leontieff, cobb douglas)
- create the consumptions goods market interaction
- create a class for industries which hold firms: agriculture (12%), food industry (10%), other manufactures (20%), commerce (10%), transportation (12%), construction (5%), services (rest)


NOT DONE
- separate other income and wage
- firing workers
- add avg price and production to table, also unemployed, employed,
- order code (all static code in the same place, handling of expenditure inside consumer and firm classes)
- price and quantity adjustments based on stock or whatever else
- make it run a certain number of months
- add in consumption as a function of desired wealth
- SEARCH FOR "WRONG" and "change" IN COMMENTS and pass in functions
- workers should be specific consumers
- create the capital goods market interaction
- create the labor market interaction
- pay wages when producing
- production/price based on expected sales + desired inventories?
- transform economic structure data into industries and firms
- transform demographic/labour data into consumer objects (1 consumer per 10k people?)
- assign people to industries according to the data
- model behaviour from firms (specific to industries?) and people
- model government
- model financial sector
- consolidate with actual data
- interface where you can create / save / load economic structure from network diagram
- firm ownership among consumers, dividends
- hiring workers



HOW TO IMPLEMENT INTERACTION?
- Consumer checks consumption/saving behaviour to determine how much to spend
- Consumer checks consumption behaviour to determine how to distribute expenses -> return a dictionary?
- Consumer goes to each industry and buys from a random firm? Looks for the cheapest firm? Looks a little bit but not too much?
